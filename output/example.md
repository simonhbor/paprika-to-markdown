# Apple Crumble
> **tags**: #sweet #5star

## Ingredients

### Filling
- 3 large cooking apples (ie something tart like Granny Smith or Bramleys if possible) - peeled and sliced
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 oz butter or marg
- 2 oz light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- Handful of sultanas

### Topping
- 6 oz flour
- Pinch salt
- 4 oz butter or marg
- 2 oz caster sugar
- (1 oz porridge oats - optional)

## Directions
Slice apples and sprinkle with lemon juice to stop them going brown 

Melt butter in large frying pan and add apples, sugar, cinnamon and sultanas.

Mix well so apples are well covered with butter and cook over medium heat until apples have softened but not gone mushy. Take off heat and put into greased casserole dish (approx 9" round) to cool down. 

Work flour, salt and butter until they are mixed together enough to form crumbs but don't over process or it will form a dough in a big lump (if that happens add more flour so it goes more crumbly). Mix in sugar (and oats if using) and sprinkle roughy evenly over apple mixture. 

Bake gas no 5 (190C, 375F) for 40 mins or until looks lightly browned on top. 

## Notes
goes well in 8 x 8 inch Pyrex dish or six squat ramekins
