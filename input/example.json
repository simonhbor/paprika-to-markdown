    "directions": "Slice apples and sprinkle with lemon juice to stop them going brown \nMelt butter in large frying pan and add apples, sugar, cinnamon and sultanas.\nMix well so apples are well covered with butter and cook over medium heat until apples have softened but not gone mushy. Take off heat and put into greased casserole dish (approx 9\" round) to cool down. \nWork flour, salt and butter until they are mixed together enough to form crumbs but don't over process or it will form a dough in a big lump (if that happens add more flour so it goes more crumbly). Mix in sugar (and oats if using) and sprinkle roughy evenly over apple mixture. \nBake gas no 5 (190C, 375F) for 40 mins or until looks lightly browned on top. \n",
